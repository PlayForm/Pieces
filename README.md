## Introduction

The Pieces SDK is a powerful code engine package designed for writing
applications on top of
[Pieces OS](/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing). It facilitates
communication with a locally hosted server to enable features such as copilot
chats, asset saving, and more.

## Requirements

The Pieces SDK has the following system requirements:

-   [Pieces OS](/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing) running as a
    backend service.
-   NodeJs environment with npm for installing the SDK package.

## 🚀 Installation

To get started with the Pieces SDK, follow these steps:

### 1. Downloading Pieces OS

Pieces OS runs in the background of your computer and serves as a hub for all
plugins and extensions developed by the team. In order to utilize your own
Server locally and support all the functionality that powers things like
[Global Search](https://docs.pieces.app/features/global-search),
[Copilot Chats](https://docs.pieces.app/features/pieces-copilot),
[Asset Saving](https://docs.pieces.app/features/managing-saved-materials),
[context](https://docs.pieces.app/features/pieces-copilot#set-your-own-copilot-context),
and more.

Select the right version to download Pieces OS for your operating system:

-   [macOS](https://docs.pieces.app/installation-getting-started/macos)
-   [Windows](https://docs.pieces.app/installation-getting-started/windows)
-   [Linux](https://docs.pieces.app/installation-getting-started/linux)

### 2. Downloading NPM Package

Using npm:

```bash
npm install @pieces.app/pieces-os-client
```

Using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add @pieces.app/pieces-os-client
```

Using yarn:

```bash
yarn add @pieces.app/pieces-os-client
```

## 🛠️ Usage

After you install the package, you can import the library into your file(s)
using require:

```javascript
const pieces = require("@pieces.app/pieces-os-client");
```

or you can import the package using import as well:

```javascript
import * as pieces from "@pieces.app/pieces-os-client";
```

> **Recommendation** The order that npm packages are saved and added to your
> dependencies is important and will affect your installation flow.
>
> **If you are having issues with your installation, it is likely due to a
> conflict in Typescript versions - `npm uninstall typescript` - then go back
> and perform all other npm installations before reinstalling typescript
> again**.

You can take a look at an example repo using the TS SDK:
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/pieces-app/example-typescript)

For detailed usage instructions and examples, refer to the
[documentation](https://docs.pieces.app/build/reference/typescript).

## Features

The Pieces SDK offers the following key features:

1. Copilot Chats: Communicate seamlessly with copilot chats functionality.
2. Asset Management: Save and manage assets and formats efficiently.
3. Local Server Interaction: Interact with a locally hosted server for various
   functionalities.
4. Multi LLMs support: Use any Pieces supported LLMs to power apps.

## Getting Started

First, we will create a Typescript script to test the connection to the Pieces
OS server. This involves creating a main.ts file to store your configuration
info to test the connection.

> It's important to note that the localhost port for Pieces OS is different
> based on the operating system.
>
> For Linux, you should use `localhost:5323`.
>
> For macOS and Windows, you should use `localhost:1000`.

Create a `main.ts` file and add the following code:

```typescript
import * as Pieces from '@pieces.app/pieces-os-client'
import os from 'os';

const platform = os.platform();
let port = 1000;

// Defining the port based on the operating system. For Linux, the port is 5323, and for macOS/Windows, the port is 1000.
if (platform === 'linux') {
  port = 5323;
} else {
  port = 1000;
}

// The `basePath` defaults to http://localhost:1000, however we need to change it to the correct port based on the operating system.
const configuration = Pieces.Configuration({
  basePath: `http://localhost:${port}`
})
// Create an instance of the WellKnownApi class
const apiInstance = new Pieces.WellKnownApi(configuration)

apiInstance.getWellKnownHealth().then((data: string) => {
  console.log(data) // ok
}).catch((error: unknown) => console.error(error))
```

Run the following command to execute the script:

```shell
ts-node main.ts
```

## Examples

Here are a few examples of using some of the basic endpoints for getting up and
running, along with creating an asset for the first time.

<details>
<summary> Connect </summary>

When developing and creating an application on top of Pieces OS, it is important
that you authenticate with the application itself when performing requests.

To 'connect' your application (this typescript project) to the server, you will
need to make a POST request to the `apiInstance.connect()` endpoint of the API
and print the response.

```tsx

import * as Pieces from '@pieces.app/pieces-os-client'

const configuration = Pieces.Configuration()
const apiInstance = new Pieces.ConnectorApi(configuration)

const body: Pieces.ConnectRequest = {
    // SeededConnectorConnection |  (optional)
    seededConnectorConnection: ,
};

apiInstance.connect(body).then((data: Context) => {
    console.log('API called successfully. Returned data: ' + data)
}).catch((error: unknown) => console.error(error))

```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Create New Assets</summary>

Now before continuing forward, we will need to prepare the `create()` function
to connect to the proper creation endpoint. Create differs from connect, since
previously our json object did not require any preprocessing. In this case **we
will need to include the application data that was returned back from our
initial call to `connect()`.**

The `createAsset()` function needs to accomplish:

1. Create our raw `data` var for seeding the asset.
2. Creating a new asset using our simple `Pieces.SeededAsset` configuration
3. Send request via `Pieces.AssetsApi().assetsCreateNewAsset()`
4. Return the created asset back after it is validated and created

Here is what the `createAsset()` function looks like in its entirety:

```tsx
// importing the package into this file.
import * as pieces from '@pieces.app/pieces-os-client'

// @var code data as a string.
var data = "<h1>Hello world</h1>";

// @var title for your snippet creation.
var name = "My First Snippet";

// the create asset function where we create our seeded asset.
// @var applicationData | look back at connect() to see where this came from
function createAsset() {
  let _seededAsset: Pieces.SeededAsset = {
    application: applicationData,
    format: {
      fragment: {
        string: {raw: data},
      },
    },
    metadata: {
      name: name
    }
  }

  // create your seed
  let _seed: Pieces.Seed = {
    asset: _seededAsset,
    type: SeedTypeEnum.Asset
  }

  // make your api call.
  new Pieces.AssetsApi().assetsCreateNewAsset({seed: _seed}).then(newAsset => {
    console.log(`New Asset Created --> ${newAsset}`);
  });
}
```

The response back will look similar to the following:

</details>

<details>
<summary>Get your Assets Snapshot</summary>

When reading along, if you would like to view your data incrementally through
the full browser window, you can navigate to `http://localhost:1000/assets` to
view a full list of snippets that have been saved in your browser. Otherwise,
you can access the snapshot with these steps:

```tsx
new Pieces.AssetsApi().assetsSnapshot({}).then(_assetList => {
    for (let i = 0; i < _assetList.iterable.length; i++) {
        // will log each asset.
       console.log(_assetsList[i]);
    }
})
```

</details>

endpoints can be found
